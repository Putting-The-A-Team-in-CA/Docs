## General Description and Purpose

### Purpose
Our app connects a medical practice with its patients. It provides an "all-in-one" solution to booking and managing appointments, viewing and selecting practice services, and accessing notes and resources from an appointment.

For medical practices, this will allow a platform to advertise available services, track appointments, and streamline the booking process.

For doctors, this will allow the managing and tracking of appointments, and as easy way to update availability throughout the day/wekk.

For patients, the app presents a simple way to book appointments and select from various medical services.

### Features
